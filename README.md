# 2024-aqp-pedometrics-workshop
AQP Workshop for the [2024 Pedometrics Meetings](http://pedometrics.org/pedometrics-2024-addressing-the-10-challenges/)

# Overview
Morning 1/2 day session; Organizer: Dylan Beaudette (USDA-NRCS)

Potential duration: 4 hours

Maximum number of participants: 20

Participant requirements: personal computer, R (version 4.2.2 or greater), pre-installation of R packages (sent out ahead of time).

This four-hour workshop will cover several R packages of interest to scientists and engineers who work with soil morphology and laboratory characterization data on a regular basis. These packages are maintained by USDA-NRCS SPSD staff and serve as key infrastructure for the routine work of the U.S. soil survey program. Participants will learn how to create and manipulate [SoilProfileCollection](https://ncss-tech.github.io/aqp/articles/Introduction-to-SoilProfileCollection-Objects.html) objects from their own data or U.S. Soil Survey data, generate soil profile sketches, aggregate over groups, and visualize many different aspects of soil profile data. There will also be several demonstrations of the Numerical Comparison of Soil Profiles (NCSP) algorithm for numerical classification of soil profile data. Case studies and example data will be based on public data sources made simple using the [soilDB](https://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/) package. Examples include: Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (point data), Soil Data Access (detailed soil survey data), Web Coverage Services supporting thematic soil property and condition mapping, as well as the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). The first half of the workshop will focus on a tour of the [aqp](https://ncss-tech.github.io/aqp/), [soilDB](https://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/), and [sharpshootR](https://ncss-tech.github.io/sharpshootR/) packages with numerous case studies that demonstrate a range of simple to advanced analyses. The second half of the workshop will include time for question/answer session, discussion of package and algorithm design choices, feature requests, and 1:1 assistance with users' specific data. A primer on these packages along with a simple pre-course assignment will be sent out one month before the workshop. This will ensure that all participants will have a fully functional R environment with the latest versions of required packages. All code, documentation, and follow-up resources will be posted to a GitHub repository for reference after the workshop and conference.
